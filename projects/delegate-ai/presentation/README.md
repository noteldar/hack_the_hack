## üöÄ Presentation Tips

### Before Presenting
1. **Practice with timer**: Use 'T' key to track timing
2. **Test on actual hardware**: Ensure smooth animations
3. **Have backup plan**: Screenshots if live demo fails
4. **Check internet**: For CDN resources
5. **Rehearse transitions**: Smooth flow between slides

### During Presentation
1. **Start with confidence**: Own the room from slide 1
2. **Use presenter remote**: Navigate smoothly
3. **Watch the timer**: Stay on track
4. **Engage judges**: Make eye contact, show passion
5. **Handle questions**: Keep answers brief, redirect to demo

### Key Messages to Emphasize
1. **Autonomous operation** - No prompts needed
2. **Multi-agent architecture** - Specialized, collaborative
3. **Real-time execution** - Happens while you work
4. **Executive focused** - Built for C-level efficiency
5. **Measurable impact** - Concrete time savings

## üé¨ Demo Alternatives

If live demo isn't possible:
- Use the animated mockups in slides
- Walk through the agent timeline step-by-step
- Show the "typing" animations as if real-time
- Emphasize the autonomous nature verbally

## üì± Mobile Responsive

Presentation works on:
- Laptops/desktops (optimal)
- Tablets (good)
- Mobile phones (functional)

# Serve locally for testing
python -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000/index.html
```
